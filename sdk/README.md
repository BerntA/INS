# Hammer++ for Insurgency mod

[Hammer++](https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/) is a modernized version of the classic Hammer tool, with a few tweaks this tool can be used with Source SDK Base 2006 / OrangeBox based mods!

### Setup

Simply copy the contents to your 'Source SDK Base' folder, then:

- Adjust the hammerplusplus_gameconfig.txt file to point to your game paths, vbsp, vvis and vrad executables.
- Adjust searchpaths in the gameinfo file to your liking, you will have to extract the base content from e.g HL2, CS:S, etc. to a folder in the Source SDK Base root, as the vpk's are not mounted correctly by Hammer++!
- Login to Steam, the legacy map compile tools require Steam to be up, however, you can recompile these tools to remove this requirement.. (see Source SDK code archives)
